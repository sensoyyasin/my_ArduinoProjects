## ArduinoProjects
Applications I tried and made while trying to learn arduino.

- Jumper wires (generic)
- Arduino UNO	
- LED (generic)
- C&K Switches PTS 645 Series Switch
- Buzzer, 5V-12V, 12mm

# Arduino Uno 
Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects.
It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It has 32 KB FLASH program memory, 2KB SRAM memory and 1KB internal EEPROM memory.

A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric. Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, train and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.
